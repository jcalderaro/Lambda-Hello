## Name
Jonathan Calderaro

## Who I am in three words
Inquisitive. Methodical. Skittish.

## My passion

My favorite hobby is a mix between indoor and outdoor activities. When I'm inside, especially on a rainy day, I'll be playing video games. 
Currently I only practice Super Smash Brother's Melee, however up until this year I had been coaching in League of Legends. On sunny days,
going on hikes and taking in the view or just a small walk around town is nice. Probably my favorite spot lately was a local Cat Cafe in San Fransisco, 
I had such a fun time going I may make it a frequent adventure.
