## Name ##
Jonathan Calderaro

## Who I am in three words
Inquisitive. Methodical. Skittish.

## My passion ##

My favorite hobby is a mix between indoor and outdoor activities. When I'm inside, especially on a rainy day, I'll be playing video games. 
Currently I only practice Super Smash Brother's Melee, however up until this year I had been coaching in League of Legends. On sunny days,
going on hikes and taking in the view or just a small walk around town is nice. Probably my favorite spot lately was a local Cat Cafe in San Fransisco, 
I had such a fun time going I may make it a frequent adventure.

## Three Words Not Like Me ##

Brave. Extroverted. Unhealthy.

## List Hobbies You Don't Participate In ##

Going out to the bar, club, or rave every weekened is my favorite hobby. Being in areas with loud music and raw energy is exactly how I want to spend time.
Instead of playing video games or going on walks, I spend all my time binge-watching movies and eating snacks.
